This is a short ruby script to generate a domain name for your website. 

It was inspired by Yipit: http://www.businessinsider.com/how-we-used-a-python-script-to-find-our-domain-name-yipit-2010-12

EXAMPLE: 
	>> (sudo) chmod a+x domains.rb
	>> ./domains.rb ly 3
		--returns ly.txt with a list of domain names beginning with 3 letter words and ending with 'ly.com'

It takes in as the first argument a root word and the second argument the length of word you want to add to the root

It will output a textfile named #{root_word}.txt with a generated domain name on each line

The domain name is an n-letter word + the root word where n is the second input argument to the script (default is 3) 
Caution: this will only work on a unix system (mac or linux) as it uses /usr/share/dict/words to get the word list. I'm not sure what you do for windows. 

You can then try godaddy's bulk uploader to check which domain names are available
